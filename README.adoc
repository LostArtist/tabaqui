**Tabaqui** is a code snippet extractor designed for collecting annotated method-level and field-level code samples from a Java project and exporting them in a structured format (JSON or YAML) for AI training purposes.

'''

== ðŸ“¦ Overview

This tool scans Java source files for custom annotations and extracts:

- The **question**
- The **answer**
- The **method/field code**

and serializes them into a machine-readable format like:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "instruction": "What does this method do?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "It pauses Kafka fetcher: protected void doSuspend() { ... }"
  }
]
----

== User guide

To use this project, you need to inject the maven dependency for custom annotating into the project you want to extract code snippets from. This https://github.com/LostArtist/ai-annotations-api[Annotation API] will allow you to annotate the code.

After you annotate all the necessary code in the project, you want to extract snippets from run the .jar file in the directory of this project:

=== Example:
[source, ]
----
java -jar target/tabaqui-jar-with-dependencies.jar --project ~/code/java/camel/components/camel-kafka --format json
----

=== Parameters:

**-p, --project** - path to the project +
**-f, --format** - output file format (json, yaml)

The output file will be placed in the annotated project directory.
